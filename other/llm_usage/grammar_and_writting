The issue of housing affordability has sparked widespread debate, with individuals and organizations proposing various solutions to address the crisis. Some advocate for increasing housing supply, while others emphasize controlling demand through policy measures. This paper aims to contribute to the discourse by identifying how impactful such solutions really are based on data-driven insights. By analyzing the relationships between key economic factors and the New Housing Price Index (NHPI), this study sheds light on effective levers to improve housing affordability.

Andrew Crosby's article @Housing-Financialization explores strategies to address rising housing costs, emphasizing a balance between supply-side measures, such as increasing affordable housing, protecting existing stock, and investing in public housing, and demand-side approaches, including tenant protections, rent controls, and reducing speculative real estate practices. The article advocates for stricter regulations on financialized landlords, long-term affordability commitments, and collaborative efforts between governments and developers to ensure housing remains accessible, particularly for marginalized communities, while resisting gentrification and displacement.

We can see such regulations recently, The Canadian government announced a two-year extension to the ban on foreign ownership of residential housing, now set to expire in 2027, as part of efforts to address affordability and prioritize housing for Canadian families. This measure is complemented by broader initiatives to accelerate housing construction, increase affordability, and support vulnerable populations through substantial federal investments and policy reforms. @regulation-canadian

## Housing Demand

Increased demand can drive up prices, especially in high-demand areas with limited housing supply. Additionally, economic growth often leads to higher construction costs, which builders pass on to buyers, further inflating prices.

The data tell us that demand is not as significant of a contributer to the prices when compared to other economic factors. 

Housing absorption, or the rate at which new homes are sold, exhibits a counterintuitive yet significant relationship with the NHPI. For every additional house sold, the NHPI decreases by 0.0003. This finding suggests that a busy housing market, characterized by high absorption rates, does not always result in higher prices. Instead, it may reflect increased supply or competitive pricing strategies by builders, or simple terms, the more the people are buying, the lower the prices it they must be. 

### True impact on housing prices
Based on our results, we know inflation and interest rates have a significantly greater impact than demand on housing prices. Bayan Yousef Farhan in @housing-affordability explores how rising Canadian house prices are influenced by inflation and increasing bank interest rates, which exacerbate affordability issues by raising the cost of mortgages and reducing purchasing power. 

## Weaknesses and Next Steps

While this study provides valuable insights, it is not without limitations. One key weakness is the reliance on aggregated data, which may mask regional disparities in housing affordability. For example, housing market dynamics in metropolitan areas like Toronto may differ significantly from those in smaller cities or rural areas. Future research should incorporate more granular data to capture these regional variations.

### Incorporating Additional Predictors
Another limitation is the exclusion of certain factors that may influence housing prices, such as population growth, zoning regulations, and international investment trends. Including these variables in future models could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors driving affordability.

### Addressing Policy Implications
Finally, the study emphasizes the need for coordinated policy interventions. While interest rate adjustments, economic growth management, and supply-side strategies can individually impact affordability, their combined effects may yield the most significant results. Policymakers should consider integrated approaches that balance demand- and supply-side measures to achieve long-term housing affordability.


## Conclusion

This paper highlights the complexity of addressing housing affordability through a data-driven lens. By analyzing the NHPI and its key predictors, it provides actionable insights into the economic factors shaping housing markets. The findings underscore the importance of interest rate policies, economic growth alignment, and efficient housing production in making homes more affordable. Moving forward, a multi-faceted approach that incorporates regional disparities and additional predictors will be crucial for developing sustainable solutions to the housing crisis.

Diverse Opinions on Housing Affordability
Housing affordability has become a critical issue, sparking widespread debate on how best to address the crisis. Solutions range from increasing housing supply to implementing demand-side policy measures. This paper aims to contribute to the discourse by assessing the effectiveness of these solutions using data-driven insights. By analyzing the relationships between key economic factors and the New Housing Price Index (NHPI), this study identifies impactful levers to improve affordability.

Andrew Crosby's article Housing Financialization highlights a balanced approach to tackling rising housing costs, emphasizing both supply-side measures—such as building affordable housing, protecting existing stock, and investing in public housing—and demand-side interventions, including tenant protections, rent controls, and reducing speculative real estate practices. The article calls for stricter regulations on financialized landlords, long-term affordability commitments, and collaborative efforts between governments and developers to resist gentrification and ensure housing accessibility for marginalized communities.

In line with these recommendations, the Canadian government recently announced a two-year extension to the ban on foreign ownership of residential housing, now set to expire in 2027. This initiative, part of a broader strategy to address affordability, aims to prioritize housing for Canadian families. Complementary measures include accelerating housing construction, enhancing affordability, and supporting vulnerable populations through significant federal investments and policy reforms.

Housing Demand
Housing demand is often cited as a major driver of prices, especially in high-demand areas with limited supply. Economic growth can also increase construction costs, which builders pass on to buyers, further inflating prices. However, the data suggest that demand is not as significant a contributor to housing prices as other economic factors.

Interestingly, housing absorption—the rate at which new homes are sold—shows an inverse relationship with the NHPI. For every additional house sold, the NHPI decreases by 0.0003. This finding implies that higher absorption rates often reflect increased supply, competitive pricing strategies by builders, or both. Simply put, a busy housing market can lead to lower prices due to greater availability.

True Impact on Housing Prices
The analysis reveals that inflation and interest rates exert a significantly greater influence on housing prices than demand. As highlighted by Bayan Yousef Farhan in Housing Affordability, rising Canadian house prices are strongly impacted by inflation and increasing bank interest rates, which raise mortgage costs and reduce purchasing power, thereby exacerbating affordability challenges.

Weaknesses and Next Steps
While this study provides valuable insights, it is not without limitations. A key weakness is the reliance on aggregated data, which may obscure regional disparities. For example, housing market dynamics in metropolitan areas like Toronto may differ substantially from those in smaller cities or rural regions. Future research should incorporate more granular data to capture these variations.

Incorporating Additional Predictors
Another limitation is the exclusion of factors such as population growth, zoning regulations, and international investment trends. Including these variables in future models would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the drivers of affordability.

Addressing Policy Implications
The study emphasizes the importance of coordinated policy interventions. While interest rate adjustments, economic growth management, and supply-side strategies each affect affordability, their combined impact may be more significant. Policymakers should consider integrated approaches that balance demand- and supply-side measures to achieve long-term housing affordability.

Conclusion
This paper underscores the complexity of addressing housing affordability through a data-driven approach. By analyzing the NHPI and its key predictors, it identifies actionable insights into the economic factors shaping housing markets. The findings highlight the critical roles of interest rate policies, economic growth alignment, and efficient housing production in improving affordability. Looking ahead, addressing regional disparities, incorporating additional predictors, and adopting multi-faceted strategies will be essential for developing sustainable solutions to the housing
