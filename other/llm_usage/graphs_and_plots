Write an R script to compare observed and simulated datasets for housing price 
analysis using a pre-trained model stored in final_model.rds. The script should
include data structure checks using glimpse, summary statistics for both 
datasets, and a visualization comparing the NHPI against predictor variables 
(rate, gdp, cpi, construction, and absorption). Use faceted scatter plots to 
highlight differences between observed and simulated data, and include 
predictions of house prices for both datasets using the model, displaying the 
results for further comparison.

Hereâ€™s the R script to address your request:

R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)

# Load the pre-trained model
final_model <- readRDS(here::here("models/final_model.rds"))

#### Compare the datasets ####

# Check the structure of both datasets
glimpse(analysis_data)
glimpse(sim_data)

# Summary statistics comparison
summary_stats <- list(
  observed = summary(analysis_data),
  simulated = summary(sim_data)
)

# Visualization: NHPI vs Predictor Variables for both datasets
# Prepare observed data
observed_long <- analysis_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("rate", "gdp", "cpi", "construction", "absorption"), 
               names_to = "Variable", 
               values_to = "Value") %>%
  mutate(Dataset = "Observed")

# Prepare simulated data
simulated_long <- sim_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("rate", "gdp", "cpi", "construction", "absorption"), 
               names_to = "Variable", 
               values_to = "Value") %>%
  mutate(Dataset = "Simulated")

# Combine datasets
combined_data <- bind_rows(observed_long, simulated_long)

# Plot comparison
comparison_plot <- combined_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Value, y = house_price, color = Dataset)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~Variable, scales = "free_x") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Observed vs Simulated NHPI",
       x = "Predictor Value",
       y = "House Price",
       color = "Dataset")

print(comparison_plot)

#### Model-based comparison ####

# Predict NHPI for observed data
observed_predictions <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(Predicted_House_Price = predict(final_model, newdata = .))

# Predict NHPI for simulated data
simulated_predictions <- sim_data %>%
  mutate(Predicted_House_Price = predict(final_model, newdata = .))

# Display predicted data
head(observed_predictions)
head(simulated_predictions)
This script ensures the analysis and visualization align with the requirements of comparing observed and simulated datasets, using the model to predict housing prices for both.
