Write an R script to compare observed and simulated datasets for housing price 
analysis using a pre-trained model stored in final_model.rds. The script should
include data structure checks using glimpse, summary statistics for both 
datasets, and a visualization comparing the NHPI against predictor variables 
(rate, gdp, cpi, construction, and absorption). Use faceted scatter plots to 
highlight differences between observed and simulated data, and include 
predictions of house prices for both datasets using the model, displaying the 
results for further comparison.

Hereâ€™s the R script to address your request:

R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)

# Load the pre-trained model
final_model <- readRDS(here::here("models/final_model.rds"))

#### Compare the datasets ####

# Check the structure of both datasets
glimpse(analysis_data)
glimpse(sim_data)

# Summary statistics comparison
summary_stats <- list(
  observed = summary(analysis_data),
  simulated = summary(sim_data)
)

# Visualization: NHPI vs Predictor Variables for both datasets
# Prepare observed data
observed_long <- analysis_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("rate", "gdp", "cpi", "construction", "absorption"), 
               names_to = "Variable", 
               values_to = "Value") %>%
  mutate(Dataset = "Observed")

# Prepare simulated data
simulated_long <- sim_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("rate", "gdp", "cpi", "construction", "absorption"), 
               names_to = "Variable", 
               values_to = "Value") %>%
  mutate(Dataset = "Simulated")

# Combine datasets
combined_data <- bind_rows(observed_long, simulated_long)

# Plot comparison
comparison_plot <- combined_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Value, y = house_price, color = Dataset)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~Variable, scales = "free_x") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Observed vs Simulated NHPI",
       x = "Predictor Value",
       y = "House Price",
       color = "Dataset")

print(comparison_plot)

#### Model-based comparison ####

# Predict NHPI for observed data
observed_predictions <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(Predicted_House_Price = predict(final_model, newdata = .))

# Predict NHPI for simulated data
simulated_predictions <- sim_data %>%
  mutate(Predicted_House_Price = predict(final_model, newdata = .))

# Display predicted data
head(observed_predictions)
head(simulated_predictions)
This script ensures the analysis and visualization align with the requirements 
of comparing observed and simulated datasets, using the model to predict housing
prices for both.

create an R script for comparing observed and simulated datasets using a 
predictive model. The script should load a pre-trained model from an RDS file, 
transform both observed and simulated datasets into a long format for 
visualization, and combine them into a single dataset labeled by source. It 
should generate a faceted scatterplot comparing predictor variables against the 
response variable, highlighting differences between observed and simulated data. 
Additionally, the code should use the model to predict the response variable 
(house_price) for both datasets and append the predictions for further analysis, 
formatted for use in a Quarto or R Markdown document with clean and concise 
chunk options.

Here's the R script tailored to your requirements:

{r}
Copy code
#| label: fig-compare-data
#| fig-cap: Comparison of Observed and Simulated Data
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Load the predictive model
final_model <- readRDS(here::here("models/final_model.rds"))

# Prepare observed data
observed_long <- analysis_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("rate", "gdp", "cpi", "construction", "absorption"),
    names_to = "Variable",
    values_to = "Value"
  ) %>%
  mutate(Dataset = "Observed")

# Prepare simulated data
simulated_long <- sim_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("rate", "gdp", "cpi", "construction", "absorption"),
    names_to = "Variable",
    values_to = "Value"
  ) %>%
  mutate(Dataset = "Simulated")

# Combine datasets for visualization
combined_data <- bind_rows(observed_long, simulated_long)

# Generate faceted scatterplot
combined_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Value, y = house_price, color = Dataset)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~Variable, scales = "free_x") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Comparison of Observed vs Simulated NHPI",
    x = "Predictor Value",
    y = "House Price",
    color = "Dataset"
  )

#### Model-based predictions ####

# Predict NHPI for observed data
observed_predictions <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(Predicted_House_Price = predict(final_model, newdata = .))

# Predict NHPI for simulated data
simulated_predictions <- sim_data %>%
  mutate(Predicted_House_Price = predict(final_model, newdata = .))

# Print preview of predictions for further analysis
head(observed_predictions)
head(simulated_predictions)
Key Notes:
Dependencies: Ensure that the tidyverse and here packages are installed and 
loaded.
Datasets: Replace analysis_data and sim_data with your actual dataset objects.
Path to Model: Update "models/final_model.rds" to the correct path if the model 
file is located elsewhere.
Formatting for Quarto/R Markdown: The chunk options ensure clean output suitable 
for a reproducible report.
This script integrates data preparation, visualization, and prediction into a 
concise workflow for comparing observed and simulated datasets.
